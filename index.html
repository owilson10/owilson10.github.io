       <h2>Bio</h2>
       
       <p>My name is <span class = "blue">Owen Wilson</span> and I am from Charlotte, North Carolina. I am a sophomore data analytics major with a concentration in
       economics and also a minor in mathematics. I just recently declared my major and am very interested in the field of data analytics. I love numbers and statistics, 
       especially when it comes to both economics and sports. I play baseball here at Denison and am a big sports statistcs guy. I am a big Carolina sports fan for 
       teams such as the Panthers, Hornets, and North Carolina Tar Heels.</p>
       
       <p>Before Denison, I attended school at <span class = "red">South Mecklenburg High School</span> where I also played baseball. At South Meck, I participated
       in various clubs and organizations including National Honor Society, Beta Club, and National Math and Science Honor Society. I tried to be very ionvolved at 
       the school and feel like I left my mark.</p>
       
       <p>I have not really thought a lot about jobs yet in relation to data analytics. However, I think I would love analytical and statistical jobs when it comes
          to both sports and business. Here is a link to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/owen-wilson-5a1a06208/">LinkedIn page</a>. Here is another link 
          that will take you to my <a href="https://github.com/owilson10">GitHub page</a>. In the future, I will be posting my projects and repositories here.</p>
